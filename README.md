Description

Game build with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and using OOP.


Instructions

The goal of the game is to keep the Happy-Bee away from the falling Snowflakes and don't let the passing by Snowballs distract your attention. You can track your scoor by simply trying to achieve longer live-time for the bee.  You would be able to see your scoor on the game-over page.


How to play 

You can use the Left and Right Arrow keys to navigate the Happy-Bee's movements. If you press the space bar you can activate an extra property, a shield of the Happy-Bee which will eliminate the falling Snowflakes from bottom to top in a line.
